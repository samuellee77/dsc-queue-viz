by Samuel Lee, Nian-Cin Wang, and Jasmine Hong

## Introduction

The history of minimum wage legislation in the United States is a journey marked by social advocacy, economic necessity, and political debate. The concept of a minimum wage was introduced to ensure that workers could earn a living wage, providing for their basic needs without falling into poverty. Over time, this idea evolved, leading to significant legislative milestones.

## Project Overview

This project visualizes the history and evolution of minimum wage laws in the United States through various interactive charts and maps. The visualizations include:

- A line graph displaying the minimum wage over time for the federal level and 50 states.
- Two line graphs for specially selected states to highlight unique trends and significant phenomenon in their minimum wage policies
- A choropleth map showcasing the minimum wage by state as of 2020 (the most recent data available to us).

## Visualizations
